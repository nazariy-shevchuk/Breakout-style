# Breakout-style
 
This breakout-style project focusses on implementing scene flow and data persistence in Unity. Scene flow is kind of an extension of the UI concepts â€“ earlier, the UI was all within the same scene but now, we use UI elements to setup transitions between scenes. Additionally in this project, you will find examples of data persistence between scenes (eg: transferring player name from the menu to main scene) as well as between sessions (eg: saving high scores and their proud owners from previous sessions).
